## 📖 Hindu Calendar Explained

### What is Panchang?
Panchang (पञ्चांग / పంచాంగం / பஞ்சாங்கம்) means "five limbs" and refers to the five elements:
1. Tithi (Lunar day)
2. Nakshatra (Constellation)
3. Yoga (Auspicious combination)
4. Karana (Half lunar day)
5. Vara (Weekday)

### Why Auspicious Timings Matter?
In Hindu tradition, certain times are considered more favorable for important activities like:
- Starting new ventures
- Weddings and celebrations
- Religious ceremonies
- Important decisions

Conversely, inauspicious periods like Rahu Kalam are best avoided for new beginnings.
